# Restaurant Tips Analysis
## Project Description
This project examines tipping patterns using the Restaurant Tips dataset. It investigates how various factors including gender, smoking habits, day of the week, dining time, and group size affect tip amounts. The project showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and data visualization using Python.
## Dataset Overview

**Source:** Tips Dataset (CSV format)

**Background:** Contains data from 244 restaurant transactions collected in the United States during 1987.

**Availability:** Dataset is accessible through the GitHub link provided above.

**Data Fields**
- total_bill: Complete bill amount (USD)
- tip: Gratuity amount (USD)
- sex: Customer gender (Male/Female)
- smoker: Whether the group included smokers (Yes/No)
- day: Dining day (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
- time: Service period (Lunch/Dinner)
- size: Party size (number of diners)

## Primary Objectives

- Examine tipping trends across different customer profiles and dining scenarios
- Analyze tipping differences by gender, smoking habits, weekdays vs. weekends, and dining periods
- Create data visualizations using histograms, box plots, and categorical charts
- Apply statistical methods and extract meaningful insights from real data

## Key Findings

- **General Pattern**: Most gratuities range from $1–4, clustering around $2–3.
- **Gender Differences:** Males provide marginally higher tips than females, but the gap is minimal.
- **Smoking Impact:** Smokers display more inconsistent tipping, ranging from very low to exceptionally high amounts.
- **Day Patterns:** Weekend tips exceed weekday amounts, with more frequent generous gratuities.
- **Meal Timing:** Dinner gratuities are typically larger and more varied compared to lunch tips.
- **Notable Cases:** Premium tips (reaching $10) predominantly occur during dinner service and weekends.
